        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>!DOCTYPE - a declaration that tells the browser what type of document it should expect when its opened</li>
          <li>The opening tag represents the start of a HTML document. Inside the tag is the attribute lang="" which informs the browser what language the web page will be in</li>
          <li>The 'head' element contains metadata  for a web application. It includes tags such as: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>style - element defines css styles associated with a website</li>
            <li>base - element that defines the base URL for a web page</li>
            <li>link - an element that connects an external resource to the HTML doc</li>
            <li>script - an element thtat embeds client-side scripts into the HTML doc</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage. It is a required and extremely important element for SEO (Search Engine Optimization.) It is contained in the head element.</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for a webpage and makes for a better viewing experience on multiple different devices. It is also contained in the head element.</li>
          <li>Meta elements define metadata about a HTML document. It is also inside the head element. Some meta attributes include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>charset - specifies character encoding for a HTML document</li>
            <li>content - specifies the value associated with the http-equiv or name attributes</li>
            <li>http-equiv - provides an HTTP header for the information/value of a content attribute</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The body element defines the body of  HTML document. It contains content that is visible to the user and all conent to be viewed by a user must be in the body element. These notes are currently in the body element.</li>
          <li>Headers h1 to h6 are representative of the level of heading for a textblock. The headers for each section of note at h2. Headers must always be put in order from h1 to h6 and there should only be one h1 for each web page.</li>
          <li>The p represents a paragraph or block of text in a HTML document.</li>
          <li>The elements ul ol and li are used to make different types of lists. The ul is used for unordered lists and the items are listed with the li tag. These notes are an example of an unordered list. The ol tag stand for ordered list and also uses the tag li to list items.</li>
          <li>The alt attribute can be used to describe an image on a web page for screen readers and greater SEO.</li>
          <li>The img element is used to display images on a web page. It is used by containing information about images using the attribute src.  The src attribute holds its importance by defining the location of an image to be displayed.</li>
          <li>The br is a tag that contains an empty space or a line break between two blocks of text.</li>
          <li>The a element stands for anchor and it is used in combination with the href attribute to create links to the same or different web pages. It is used in the format a = hrek"link would be here" with the name for the link here between open and closing brackets.</li>
          <li>A section is what we are in right now! More specfically it is a semantic element the defines a section of a document that contains thematic content. Our current "theme" is HTML notes!</li>
          <li>The id attribute is used in a HTML document to identify and select certain elements. This becomes important when CSS is added to a web page.</li>
          <li>The footer element contains information at the bottom of a web page. This can include copyright, author, contact information, a sitemap and navigation.</li>
          <li>Other mentions:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Semantic HTML elements are elements that make it easier to read a HTML document. They are important because the ease of reading is necessary for the collaborative nature of coding. Using semantic elements also impacts how accessible a site is to the broadest variety of users accessing it. It is considered best practice to use semantic elements wherever possible.</li>
            <li>Elements vs tags. An element includes everthing from the opening and closing tag whereas a tag only refers to the information contained between angle brackets. The two terms are still often used interchangeably.</li>
            <li>Element descriptors. Elements that are nested inside other elements (an example being meta elements inside the head tag) are called child elements while the element they are nested in is called a parent element.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Three types of CSS style sheets:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS - put directly into an HTML file. Customizes elements by each individual tag and can only be edited individually. Is used by using the style tag.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS - put directly in an HTML file in the head element. Also edits each element individually. Changes made to a specfic tag make changes to all tags on that name. For example if the h1 tag was assigned the color red, every h1 tag would become red.</li>
            <li>External CSS - is put in a separate sheet that is linked to the HTML file using the link element; link rel="stylesheet" href=" name of the style file is usually just style.css" this method is the most common when to use CSS styling elements which follows the separation of concerns model. there are a few main components to external CSS:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>selector - chooses which element are being selected for styling. * selector is used to apply a change to the entire page.</li>
              <li>declaration - a statement with two parts; property: value and if there are multiple declarations for one selector all of the declarations are referred to as a declaration block. Property is what we want to apply to the value. An example is color: blue. We want to assign the value 'blue' to the property 'color'</li>
            </ul>
            <li>CSS Box Model - every element within an HTML document is contained within a box. Each box has margins which are not visible on the outside of an element, a border which goes around the element, padding which is between the content(which is the final box) and the border. We can utilize and customize these boxes using CSS</li>
            <li>Class attributes can be assigned in the HTML file to certain elements and can be set as a selector which is then customized with declarations in CSS</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Version Control: Allows tracking and mangement of changes made to a codebase. Whenever an version is saved with version control it is assigned a SHA or hash identifier which allows a record of changes made to be kept and also be accessible if reverting to an older version of the code is necessary. Only the first 7 numbers need to be typed out for a devloper to access a previous version which saves time that would be spent typing out the entire thing.</li>
          <li>Git revert can be used to revert to a previous version of code. Can keep track locally.</li>
          <li>Git - a version control system that allows managing and keeping track of each version of code of a project possible. Git is access in the command line through Git Bash. Git commands always start with 'git'. Using git commands make creating a repository, adding code to the repository and view different versions of code possible with each version of code stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>GitHub - a cloud-based hosting service that allows for keeping track of repositories that are stored remotely. It also allows for collaboration to take place which is fundamental to how most coding works in practice. There are other git-based hosting repositories as well including BitBucket and SourceForge. The advantage of cloud based models is allowign multiple people to work to make separate changes to a program at the same time without conflicting issues.</li>
          <li>Repository - A project on github is called a repository, this is where all the work that is made on the code including past versions is stored. More specfically, what is stored in a repo:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>files that contain code</li>
            <li>files that contain other information about the code(ex. README file)</li>
            <li>the version history for all the files in the repo</li>
            <li>a licensing agreement</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Branch - A workspace where changes that don't affect the live site can be made. Making a new branch to store new work made to the code is best practice and should be the start to any new changes made.</li>
          <li>Markdown(.md) - This is how content files are formatted on Github; it is a way to write for the web using plain text and it converts easily to HTML. Markdown files are marked with the .md file extension.</li>
          <li>Commit changes - Saving a new version of a file that is being worked on. Whenever a file is added, edited or deleted a commit is made. It adds changes to the branch currently being worked in and is part of the pull request process.</li>
          <li>Pull request(PR) - Asking for changes that have been made in one branch to merge into another branch and is a way to share, discuss and review changes made on the project. In detail the pull request process follows these steps:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>watch video again and put steps here</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Merge - When a PR is approved changes are "pulled" or merged into the main branch. When this occurs the changes made will become a part of the live site.</li>
          <li>Issues - A way to report new tasks or content fixes. Issues are used to track progress on a project, it is best practice to open a issue for a new task and close issues as they are completed. Git issues allow for:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>track, organize, and communicate ideas, task, bugs and enhancements</li>
            <li>identify bottlenecks or blockers that could prevent progress</li>
            <li>avoid duplication by assigning tasks</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Git Workflow - </li>
          <ol>
            <li>Creating a new branch: Make a content change on new branch that is the up to date with the main branch to keep from creating issues when merging</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Adding commits</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Open a pull Rrquest: Content changes are reviewed by others or on your own if its a solo project; when working with other people assigning someone to review the content changes and approve the pull request</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Discuss and review</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Merge and deploy: Content changes are approved and merging from the new branch into the main branch occurs. Preview on site to double check.</li>
            <li>Some useful git commands:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>git status - check what branch you are currently working int</li>
              <li>git checkout [branch name] - switch to another branch</li>
              <li>git checkout -b [branch name] - creates new branch and moves you to it</li>
              <li>git add -A - adds modifications to the current working branch and identifies we want to add all changes</li>
              <li>git commit -m "message here"- captures snapshot of current staged changes and adds a message to explain the changes made</li>
              <li>git pull origin main - checks that the main branch is up to date</li>
              <li>git push origin [branch name] - pushes the changes made to the branch listed to github which creates a pull request</li>
              <li>git branch -d [branch name] - deletes a branch locally</li>
              <li>del -f ./.git/index.lock - solution to issue with index.lock when trying to commit changes</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic JavaScript features include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Strings: </li>
            <li>Variable: A container that stores a value; can hold values of different data types; if declared with keyword 'let'</li>
            <li>Arrays: Is a way of listing multiple value in one container. Values that can be listed include strings, numbers, and booleans</li>
            <li>Functions: A way to reuse blocks of code. Functions have two parts, the declaration and the call. The declaration defines the paramenters in which a function is called and what it will do and the call executes the function.</li>
            <li>for Loops: One of the most basic types of loop. A loop runs through a block of code until the conditions for running are no longer met. </li>
            <li>if Statements: A type of conditional statement. It compares whether or not a statement returns true. If the statement is true defined paramenters are executed, if it returns false other parameters are executed.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Data Types: strings, number, boolean, array, object</li>
          <li>Control Flow - The order in which code is executed. This can be circumvented with functions or loops. Code in JavaScript is executed from top to bottom so the order in which code is written is very important.</li>
          <li>OOP - Object Oriented Programming; JavaScript is an OOP language</li>
          <li>Object - Everything in JavaScript is an object that can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li>Operators:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>+ Addition and concatenation of strings(joining two separate strings together) </li>
            <li>- Subtraction</li>
            <li>/ Division</li>
