# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project was created to create a website to easily reference the material learned in the prework before the bootcamp starts. Using this website I can visit my notes on the four sections covered in the prework and use the console to give me a topic to study first if I don't know where to start.

## Usage

There are four sections in the prework study guide. Each section can be used to study a different area that was covered during the prework. The four sections include three different programming languages as well as notes on git and github. The notes on HTML go over some basic HTML topics and definitions. The CSS notes do the same as well as Git and JavaScript sections. Each section can be utilized as a quick way to reference the material learned in one place. They can also be used as a review when coming closer to the start date of the bootcamp.
